# Chitti

---

### In one line,

Chitti is a Newsletter publication and distribution platform to help Content creators reach their audience directly andmonetize from the loyal ones.

### Who is this for?

Content creators are often not rewarded for the quality of their content due to the limitations and nuances of their Social Media algorithms. Chitti intends to provide a platform for them to write, publish and distribute their content in its purest form via newsletters directly to their audience inboxes.

### How do they Benefit?

Creators can easily publish their content and reach only their select and interested audience, and in doing so, are rewarded directly by those who find value in their content.

Audiences who are interested in specific creators often end up paying directly (Magazine subscriptions) or indirectly (Offering data to Social media apps) way more than what they are required to. With Chitti, they can only subscribe to their favourite creators and enjoy their content without the clutter.

### How is this different?

Unlike Wordpress or Medium, Chitti doesn't charge anything upfront. We only make money when creators do. Also, creators’ content reaches the audience directly, eliminating the need to visit the creators’ website / blog every time there is new content.

Unlike Social Media, the audience and creators are actually connected directly to each other, without all the unnecessary noise and clutter of the platform.
